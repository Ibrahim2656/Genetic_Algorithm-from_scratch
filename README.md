# Genetic Algorithm in Python

## Overview
This project implements a genetic algorithm from scratch in Python. Genetic algorithms are search heuristics inspired by the process of natural selection. They are commonly used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems


## Features
- Genetic Operators: Implemented genetic operators include selection, crossover, and mutation.
- Customizable Parameters: Easily adjust parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and number of generations.
- Visualization: Visualize the evolution of populations and fitness over generations.
## Data
Describe any datasets used by your genetic algorithm or provide instructions on how users can input their own data.
